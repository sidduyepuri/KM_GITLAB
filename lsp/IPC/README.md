## Lab Asisgnments on Process Synchronization

### Related Process Communication [fork() & exec()]

#### Assignment 1: program name: prod-cons-rel.c
	Write a single program for producer and consumer problem using,
	- fork()
 	- shared memory
	- synchronizing using named semaphores.

#### Assignment 2: program names: prod-rel.c, cons-rel.c
	Write a separate program for producer and consumer problem using,
	- fork(), exec() 
	- shared memory.
	- Synchronizing using named seamphore.

### Unrelated Process Communication [Without fork() & exec()]:

#### Assignment 3: program names: prod-unrel.c, cons-unrel.c
	Write a separate program for producer.c and consumer.c using,
	- Shared Memory, 
	- synchronizing using named semaphores 
	- without using fork() and exec() system calls.
