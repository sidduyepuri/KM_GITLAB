Interface a 1.8 inch Color SPI TFT module (ST7735) with an STM32F401RBT6 controller.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AIM:- The final output should print 'Kernel Masters' on the TFT screen.
----
PROCEDURE/APPROACH:-
------------------
1).Studied ST7735 TFT(Thin film transistor) module datasheet to understood specifications, communication protocols,and register programming.
2).Then referred Raayanmini Document for which pins connected to TFT module.
	 SCK :: Serial clock input -> connect to SPI SCK pin
	 SDA :: Serial data input -> Connect to SPI MOSI pin
	 DC :: Data/Command selection -> Connect to PA0
	 RESET :: Reset -> Connect to PA1
	 CS :: Chip Select -> Connect to PA4
3).In STM32CubeMX configured PA0,PA1,PA4 ,Enabled SPI and Generated code.
4).Downloaded ST7735 TFT module device driver from the internet and understood driver initialization,configuration,and operation functions.
5).For Fonts i included fonts.h and .c and for colors GFX_FUNCTIONS.h and .c  file, for display i included ST7735.c and ST7735.h file.
5).added TFT module device Driver (.c) and (.h) files in inc and src folders of project.
6).Compiled in keil IDE and got errors, rectified those errors and make code as error free.
7).Then binary file created in keil and flash loaded into Raayan mini board.
8).Then pressed RESET button.
9).Got output on TFT module ,output is "KERNEL MASTERS".

Problems Faced in Project:-
--------------------------
1.Downloaded so many TFT module device drivers from internet, but i got header file errors.
2.Finally got output with one stm32 board related TFT module device driver.
3.I downloaded TFT module device drivers for STM32F441, but Rayaan mini board having STM32F401 microcontroller.Pins for both microcontrollers different.
4.So i reffered Raayan mini manual to know the pin configuration of the TFT module.
