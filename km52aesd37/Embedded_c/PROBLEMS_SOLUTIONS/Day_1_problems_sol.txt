1.ERROR CODE LOADING
  Summary:- Error:Flash Download Failed -could not load file
  Solution:- clear all the Errors

2.Without connecting Target board
  Summary:- NO ST_LINK detected
  Solution:- connect ST_LINK debugger properly and check it in debug section

3.Character array(string) declare and initialization after RCC_init(),LCD_config()......
  Summary:- Declaration may not appear after executable statement in block
  Solution:- Declare & initialization must be declared at the beginning of the main() program

4.Wrong Address communication
  Summary:- whenever giving wrong address ,it will goes to end of the program.
  Solution:- Give correct address mentioned in the manual.

5.Framework is neccessary
  Summary:- The way of initialization & configuration done properly,otherwise we can't get output
  Solution:- Follow the framework.

6.without clearing LCD
  Summary:-without clearing LCD don't write anything, if write it will be concatnated. it's not a proper output.
  Solution:- To overcome this problem first we need to clear lcd.

7.Do not RESET in debug mode
  Summary:-In Debugging mode we can check way of execution, but don't press RESET button,it leads to damage microcontroller.
  Solution:- Avoid RESET button,and better to use RESET option in debug mode.

8.Blocking
  Summary:-There is disconnection of internet,at that time entire is program is blocked.
  Solution:-Better to use Timeout function.

9.Master-slave communication
  summary:-In SPI while communication of master-slave we can't control from slave,we chance from master only.
  solution:-It's a full duplex communication so master only can handle this.

10.BOOT MODE
  summary:-Don't change BOOT MODE,if we change we cannot upload into the microcontroller.
  solution:-so,keep it maintain '2' as HIGH (UP)&'1' as LOW(DOWN).
