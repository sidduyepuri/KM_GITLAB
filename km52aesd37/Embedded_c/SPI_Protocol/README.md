DATE: 22-NOV-2023 || TOPIC: SPI Protocol

Experiment 1:Write a pseudo code and Embedded C program to SPI1 Configuration using the below conditions,
	And transmit character ‘A’ and Receive same character using hardware Loop back.
	a. Full duplex comm.
	b. Motorola Frame format
	c. Enable Polling (nothing but disable SPI Interrupts)
		Short PA6 & PA7 pins

		PA4 - SPI1-NSS
		PA5 - SPI1-SCK
		PA6 - SPI1-MISO
		PA7 - SPI1-MOSI

Experiment 2:  Above lab experiment with SPI Rx Interrupt. 

Experiment 3: Develop Communication between two Raayn MIni Boards using SPI protocol same as previous lab experiment using UART?
