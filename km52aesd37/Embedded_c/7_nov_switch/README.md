1. Lab Experiment 3:
 Whenever SW-UP is pressed RED LED is ON, whenever SW-DN is pressed GREEN LED is ON.
Assign breakpoints after if condition and click run button in debugger window. WheneverSW1/SW2 presses program stops at any one of the breakpoint.

2. Lab Experiment 4: Use “SW-ENT” and declare “counter” global variable. Your program should increment counter
	by one, every time switch is pressed. Note how the value of counter changes on each “E	NTER SWITCH” press. Use debugger and add Counter to “Watch Expression” window. Does the value of counter increment by one always?
	Note: Define counter as a global variable and in debug perspective use continuous refresh option (You will find Continuous Refresh button on top of the Expression Window). You can use step debugging or breakpoints to check the variable value.
	Hint: To add variable to Expression Window, select and right click the variable name and select “Add Watch Expression”. To view Expression Window, click on View button from Keil menu bar and select Expressions.

3. Lab Experiment 5: Whenever ENTER SWITCH is Press toggle RED LED.
Lab Experiment 6: Read SW-ENT, if switch is press RED LED is ON otherwise RED LED is OFF. Note that RED LED
should remain ON for the duration switch is kept pressed i.e. RED LED should turn OFF when switch is released.

4. Lab Experiment 7: Whenever SW-ENT Press turn ON BUZZER up to 250msec and Turn OFF BUZZER.
